## Final Integration Test Summary

### All Issues Resolved âœ…

#### 1. **RuntimeWarning Fixed**
- **Issue**: `RuntimeWarning: invalid value encountered in sqrt`
- **Root Cause**: Unsafe sqrt calculations in both voice recognition and GUI audio meter
- **Solution**: Added robust error handling with input validation and NaN/infinity checks
- **Files Fixed**: `src/voice_recognition.py`, `src/gui.py`

#### 2. **Missing Method Error Fixed**
- **Issue**: `AttributeError: 'VoiceControlGUI' object has no attribute '_process_recognition'`
- **Root Cause**: Recognition loop called non-existent method
- **Solution**: Implemented `_process_recognition` method that calls `command_processor.process_command()`
- **Files Fixed**: `src/gui.py`

#### 3. **Audio Meter Implemented**
- **Issue**: GUI audio meter progress bar was not functional
- **Solution**: Added complete audio monitoring system with real-time updates
- **Features Added**:
  - Real-time audio level monitoring
  - Thread-safe GUI updates every 50ms
  - Proper integration with start/stop listening
  - Resource cleanup on application exit
