## Audio Meter Implementation Summary

### Issue Fixed
The GUI audio meter progress bar was created but not connected to any audio monitoring functionality.

### Solution Implemented
Added comprehensive audio meter functionality to `src/gui.py`:

#### 1. Added Required Imports
- `pyaudio` for audio stream access
- `numpy` for audio level calculations
- `time` for thread timing

#### 2. Added Audio Monitoring State Variables
```python
self.audio_monitor_active = False
self.audio_monitor_thread = None
self.current_audio_level = 0
```

#### 3. Implemented Audio Monitoring Methods

**`_start_audio_monitor()`**
- Starts audio level monitoring in a separate thread
- Begins GUI update timer for the progress bar

**`_stop_audio_monitor()`** 
- Stops audio monitoring thread
- Cleans up resources

**`_audio_monitor_loop()`**
- Runs in separate thread to continuously read audio input
- Calculates RMS volume from audio data
- Normalizes volume to 0-100 scale for progress bar
- Handles audio stream errors gracefully
- Uses same audio device settings as voice recognition

**`_update_audio_meter()`**
- Updates the GUI progress bar with current audio level
- Schedules next update every 50ms while monitoring is active
- Runs on main GUI thread for thread safety

#### 4. Integration with Voice Recognition
- Audio monitoring starts when "Start Listening" is clicked
- Audio monitoring stops when "Stop Listening" is clicked  
- Audio monitoring stops when GUI window is closed
- Uses same audio device configuration as voice recognition

#### 5. Audio Level Calculation
- Reads audio chunks using PyAudio
- Converts to numpy array for processing
- Calculates RMS (Root Mean Square) volume
- Normalizes to percentage scale (0-100)
- Updates progress bar in real-time

### Benefits
- **Real-time feedback**: Users can see audio input levels immediately
- **Device verification**: Confirms selected audio device is working
- **Visual confirmation**: Shows when speech is being detected
- **Troubleshooting aid**: Helps identify audio input issues
- **Professional appearance**: Makes the GUI more polished and functional

### Testing
- GUI launches successfully with audio meter
- Audio meter shows real-time levels from selected eMeet microphone
- No conflicts with voice recognition functionality
- Proper cleanup when stopping or closing application

The audio meter is now fully functional and provides valuable real-time feedback to users about their audio input levels.
